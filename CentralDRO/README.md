This project does not compile because it is the first try to join all the code together.
The code was tested part by part: tachometer,  X axis reading and Y axis reading.
The cpu used for this project is STM32-103C8 the blue pill.
The error is about variables not found for axis. I must to reasearch how the axis work to fix the errors.
